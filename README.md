A professional **role-based internal company dashboard** that simulates real-world enterprise workflows where UI, routes, and permissions change based on user role (Admin, Manager, Employee).

This project is designed to reflect **real internal tools used inside companies**, not tutorial-style portfolio apps.

## 🧠 Project Purpose

In real organizations:

- Different employees have different permissions  
- The same system behaves differently for each role  
- Frontend developers must handle access control and conditional UI rendering  

This project demonstrates how modern frontend developers build **role-aware internal dashboards** used inside companies.
